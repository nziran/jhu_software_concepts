      I am a practicing, board-certified orthopaedic trauma surgeon with a focus on

      I am currently expanding my technical skill set in software development and
      artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on building practical, AI-based
      solutions that can be applied in the operating room to support clinical
      decision-making.
